# My Data Analyst Journey


Welcome to my Data Analyst learning repository!

This repository is a living log of my progress. I’ll be using this space to:
- Practice SQL and data querying
- Document concepts and patterns I learn
- Analyze public datasets
- Share project results and reflections

## 📁 Repository Structure

Here’s how this repository is organized:

```data-analyst/
├── sql/
│ ├── 01-select-basics.sql
| ├── ... (more SQL exercises by topic)
│
├── sql_results/
│ ├── 01-select-basics/
| ├── ... (output folders for each topic)
│
├── notes/
| ├── ... (SQL notes, learning log, cheat sheets)
│
├── datasets/
│ ├── employee_information.csv
| ├── employee_salary.csv
| ├── departments.csv
│
└── README.md
```


## ✅ What You’ll Find Here

### 📚 `sql/`
SQL queries organized by topic — including:
- Basic SELECTs
- Queries for data cleaning and data exploration

Each `.sql` file in the repository contains multiple numbered queries, each with a descriptive comment explaining its purpose.

```
/sql
    employees.sql
/results
    /employees
        01-results.csv
        02-results.csv
        03-results.csv
```

---

### 📊 `results/`
Contains:
- The results/ directory contains a subfolder named exactly after the SQL file
- Inside that subfolder, each CSV file is prefixed with the query number (01-, 02-, etc.) to match the numbered queries in the SQL file.
- Screenshots of query results (if using a visual tool like MySQL Workbench or DBeaver)
- Real-world output samples to visualize how queries perform

---

### 🧠 `notes/`
This is where I reflect on what I’m learning. Includes:
- `learning-log.md`: Weekly logs tracking what I’ve studied, challenges, and what’s next
- `sql-cheat-sheet.md`: Quick reference for key SQL concepts

---

### 🗒️ `pivot_tables/`
This is where the pivot tables exist.  Includes:
- An extension for .xlsx
- Since the excel sheet isn't visible correctly, I have also includes a csv file
- For visual purposes, I have included a png file
- For additional context, I have included a notes section where I explain the results of each table

---

### 📁 `datasets/`
Practice datasets (public or self-created) that I use for writing queries and doing exploratory analysis.
