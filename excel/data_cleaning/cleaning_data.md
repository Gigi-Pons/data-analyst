## âœ… Things to Look for When Cleaning Data

### 1. Duplicate Data
- Use **Remove Duplicates** (Data tab â†’ Remove Duplicates).
- Check across multiple columns to avoid partial duplicates.
- Highlight duplicates with **Conditional Formatting** for review.

### 2. Standardize Text Formatting
- Ensure consistent **case formatting** (all UPPERCASE, lowercase, or Proper Case).
- Use functions like `=UPPER()`, `=LOWER()`, or `=PROPER()`.
- Rename inconsistent column headers.

### 3. Spelling & Typo Errors
- Use Excelâ€™s **Spell Check** (F7).
- Standardize categorical values (e.g., "Republican" vs "Republicans").
- Check for inconsistent abbreviations.

### 4. Extra Spaces & Hidden Characters
- Use `=TRIM()` to remove leading, trailing, or double spaces.
- Use `=CLEAN()` to remove non-printable characters (common in imported data).

### 5. Date & Time Formatting
- Make sure all dates follow the same format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
- Use `Short Date` to fix imported dates stored in different date formats.
